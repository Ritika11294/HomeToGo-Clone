## HomeToGo
In this project we have tried to make a look alike clone of HomeToGo Website. With our efforts and the technology stack, that we have learned till now in Unit-3 in Masai School, we were able to clone the front end with similar looks and features.

## Technologies we used
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>
Along with that, in order to store user data and property data we also used LocalStorage.
